1.When selecting fruit trees, choose resistant varieties if possible.\n
2.Keep the soil under the tree clean and rake up fallen fruit.\n
3.Use a thick layer of mulch to cover the soil after you have raked and cleaned it well. Mulch will reduce weeds and prevent the disease pathogen from splashing back up onto the leaves.\n
4.Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation. Make sure to disinfect your pruning equipment (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.\n
5.Leaf spot among vegetables is most often introduced through infected seed or transplants. Make sure your seeds and transplants are from leaf spot-free stock.\n

        There is no cure for plants infected with bacterial leaf spot. Preventive, organic measures include:\n

1.Spraying with a baking soda solution (a tablespoon of baking soda, 2 1/2 tablespoons of vegetable oil, a teaspoon of liquid soap, not detergent, to one gallon of water), or neem oil (do not use when pollinating insects including bees or other beneficial insects are present). Baking soda may burn some plant leaves. Spray only a few and then check for a reaction before applying applications every two weeks.\n
2.Apply sulfur sprays or copper-based fungicides weekly at first sign of disease to prevent its spread. These organic fungicides will not kill leaf spot, but prevent the spores from germinating.\n
3.Safely treat most fungal and bacterial diseases with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis that is registered for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects.\n
4.Containing copper and pyrethrins, Bonide® Garden Dust is a safe, one-step control for many insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, cover both the tops and undersides of leaves with a thin uniform film or dust. Depending on foliage density, 10 oz will cover 625 sq ft. Repeat applications every 7-10 days, as needed.\n

    <string name="lateblight">
1.Plant resistant cultivars when available.\n
2.Remove volunteers from the garden prior to planting and space plants far enough apart to allow for plenty of air circulation.\n
3.Water in the early morning hours, or use soaker hoses, to give plants time to dry out during the day — avoid overhead irrigation.\n
4.Destroy all tomato and potato debris after harvest (see Fall Garden Cleanup).\n

If symptoms are observed, treat plants with one of the following fungicides:\n

1.Apply a copper based fungicide (2 oz/ gallon of water) every 7 days or less, following heavy rain or when the amount of disease is increasing rapidly. If possible, time applications so that at least 12 hours of dry weather follows application.\n
2.Used as a foliar spray, Organocide® Plant Doctor will work its way through the entire plant to prevent fungal problems from occurring and attack existing many problems. Mix 2 tsp/ gallon of water and spray at transplant or when direct seeded crops are at 2-4 true leaf, then at 1-2 week intervals as required to control disease.\n
3.Safely treat fungal problems with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis and is approved for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects.\n
4.Monterey® All Natural Disease Control is a ready-to-use blend of naturally occurring ingredients that control most plant foliar diseases. All stages of the disease is controlled, but applying before infestation gives the best results.\n

        1.Crop residue should be removed and destroyed after harvest.\n
2.Start with certified, disease-free seed or treat seed with hot water.\n
3.Sanitize greenhouse thoroughly in between crop cycles.\n
4.Minimize long periods of leaf wetness by avoiding wetting the foliage and the use of fans to circulate air.\n
5.Staking and pruning to increase ventilation reduces disease spread.\n
6.Maintain night temperatures in the greenhouse higher than outside temperatures.\n
7.Fungicides effectively control this disease.\n
    </string>
    <string name="septoria">
        1.Removing infected leaves.  Remove infected leaves immediately, and be sure to wash your hands thoroughly before working with uninfected plants.\n
2.Consider organic fungicide options. Fungicides containing either copper or potassium bicarbonate will help prevent the spreading of the disease. Begin spraying as soon as the first symptoms appear and follow the label directions for continued management.\n
3.Consider chemical fungicides. While chemical options are not ideal, they may be the only option for controlling advanced infections. One of the least toxic and most effective is chlorothalonil (sold under the names Fungonil and Daconil).\n
    </string>
    <string name="mosaic">
        1.Fungicides will NOT treat this viral disease.\n
2.Plant resistant varieties when available or purchase transplants from a reputable source.\n
3.Do NOT save seed from infected crops.\n
4.Spot treat with least-toxic, natural pest control products, such as Safer Soap, Bon-Neem and diatomaceous earth, to reduce the number of disease carrying insects.\n
5.Harvest-Guard® row cover will help keep insect pests off vulnerable crops/ transplants and should be installed until bloom.\n
6.Remove all perennial weeds, using least-toxic herbicides, within 100 yards of your garden plot.\n
7.The virus can be spread through human activity, tools and equipment. Frequently wash your hands and disinfect garden tools, stakes, ties, pots, greenhouse benches, etc. (one part bleach to 4 parts water) to reduce the risk of contamination.\n
8.Avoid working in the garden during damp conditions (viruses are easily spread when plants are wet).\n
9.Avoid using tobacco around susceptible plants. Cigarettes and other tobacco products may be infected and can spread the virus.\n
10.Remove and destroy all infected plants (see Fall Garden Cleanup). Do NOT compost.\n
    </string>
    <string name="yellow">
        1.Fields should be inspected daily for the presence of whiteflies. A trap can be made with a piece of board 12 inches x 12 inches painted bright yellow. Spread petroleum jelly or Biotac on it. The yellow colour attracts the whiteflies to the boards and they stick to them. The boards are placed at the height of the plants. Monitor all crops, not just tomato plants as the whitefly may have passed the virus onto another crop.\n
2.Plants that show signs of the virus after 3-4 weeks of transplanting should be bagged (to prevent the whiteflies leaving), uprooted and burned to reduce spread of the virus.\n
3.Plants should be watered and fertilized adequately to reduce stress and to build plant health.\n

        Chemical control:\n

1.Imidacloprid should be sprayed on the entire plant and below the leaves; eggs and flies are often found below the leaves. Spray every 14-21 days and rotate on a monthly basis with Abamectin so that the whiteflies do not build-up resistance to chemicals.\n
2.Chemicals are most effective when used early in the morning and late in the evening. This is because insects are most active at these times of the day.\n
